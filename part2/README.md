### Question 1

Write a function `wordCounts` which takes a string and returns a data structure containing the count of each word in the string, not including the following separators: ` `, `,`, `-`, `.`, `?`, `!`

### Question 2

Write tests for your function in `tests/index.js`

Run `grunt` to make sure your tests pass.

### Question 3

Use jQuery or another appropriate library to show word frequency in descending order and ascending order, based on a radio button in `index.html`.

Grunt will use `browserify` to compile all modules to a single file.

### Question 4

Show words in alphabetical order and reverse alphabetical order, with word frequency, based on a radio button in `index.html`.
