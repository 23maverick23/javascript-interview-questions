# Javascript Interview Questions

### Setup

There are two problem sets in folders `part1` and `part2`. Each part uses `nodejs` to run unit tests and to bundle CommonJS modules for use in the browser.

`grunt` is already set up to run these tasks, but you will need to install `grunt` if you do not already have it installed:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then for each of the problem sets, install local dependencies in the appropriate folder, then use `grunt` to run the build tasks:

```
cd part1
npm install
grunt
```

Feel free to make use of any additional libraries you feel are appropriate.
